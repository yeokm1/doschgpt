// TcpSocketMgr
//
// Dedicated class to manage active and free sockets.  If we handle the
// management of sockets we should be able to save the user from errors.
// Also, by managing a pool ourselves we avoid repeated calls to
// malloc/free which can fragment the DOS heap.
//
// There is only one instance of this so all methods and vars are static.
