// RingBuffer is used by TCP to manage the queues of packets.  Performance
// is fairly important as these queues are traversed fairly often.
//
// Alignment will always be at least a word.  Our counters are words and
// we store pointers which are words or double words.

// RINGBUFFER_SIZE must be a power of 2.
