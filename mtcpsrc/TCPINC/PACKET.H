// The number of packet buffers is limited by the amount of memory you can
// allocate with malloc.
//
// The packet buffer minimum length is based on SLIP connections with emulated Ethernet.
// We want that MSS to be 256 + 40 bytes for IP and TCP headers, and 14 bytes for the
// emulated Ethernet header.  Less might work but do your research; at this minimum you
// are already in danger of fragmenting DNS packets.

// Packet driver and Buffer management
//
// This header file describes the code that interfaces directly with the
// packet driver.
//
// The first major chunk of code is the code that talks to the packet driver.
// This is generally done by software interrupt.  There are functions to
// register with the packet driver, get the MAC address, send a packet, unload,
// etc.  There is also code that the packet driver will call when it receives
// a packet from the wire.
//
// The second chunk of code deals with receive buffer management.  Send
// buffers and receive buffers are handled differently; this code does not
// manage the buffers used to send data.  When the packet driver receives
// a packet from the wire it makes two calls; one to get a buffer to copy
// the packet into, and one to tell this code that the copy is done.  If
// no buffers are available to give to the packet driver you can tell it
// that, but that will cause the packet driver to drop the packet into
// the bit bucket.  So this is to be avoided.



// Buffer management
//
// These functions are used for setting up and controlling the pool of buffers
// that the packet driver will use when a packet is received.  The number of
// buffers to create and their size is set in the PACKET_BUFFERS and
// PACKET_BUFFER_LEN defines
//
// Buffer_init: Allocate the buffers and initialize the data structures.  The
//   data structures are a free buffer stack and a ring buffer of buffers
//   that will hold any new data from the packet driver that needs to be
//   processed.  Returns 0 if all went well, non-zero if an error happened.
//
// Buffer_startReceiving: When first initialized the buffers are created
//   but we set up the data structures such that if the packet driver asks
//   for a buffer we tell it none are available.  This allows us to setup
//   the higher levels of the network stack and make sure everything is
//   ready before allowing packets to start being processed.  When you are
//   ready call this function and then the packet driver will be able
//   to receive data into buffers.
//
// Buffer_free: Higher levels of the stack (ARP, IP, etc.) use this function
//   to return a buffer to the free pool so it can be reused again.
//
// Buffer_stopReceiving: The opposite of startReceiving.  This tells the
//   buffer layer to lie to the packet driver by saying there are no
//   free buffers available.  This is the first step toward unloading
//   everything.
//
// Buffer_stop: Tear everything down and release the memory.  (Make sure
//   no buffers are still in use before calling this.  This should be the
//   last thing that you do; see Utils::endStack( ) to see an example of
//   how to shut things down safely.

// Stats
//
// If your machine is too slow or you are not servicing the packets fast enough
// you can run out of free buffers to receive new data into and cause new
// incoming packets to be dropped in the bit bucket.  This variable serves as a
// "low water" mark so that you know how close to running out of buffers your
// code has come.  If this hits zero you might need to add more buffers or
// make your code faster.

// Experimental for the SNTP time server
//
// Allows for the tagging of all incoming packets with a timestamp.  This is
// a hack; the real solution is to create a struct for incoming buffers so the
// pointer to the struct can be passed around instead of passing the buffer
// address, length, and timestamp separately.

// Packet driver
//
// This code registers with the packet driver and tries to take every possible
// Ethernet frame type (EtherType) for itself.  The only way this would cause
// a conflict is if you had a TSR tht was already using the packet driver.
// That could only work if that TSR did not try to handle IP or ARP frames;
// fix this code if it is a problem for you.
//
// Once initialized, you have to tell this code (packet.cpp) what the handlers
// are for each EtherType and/or provide a default handler for anything you
// did not explicitly provide a handler for.  If you do not provide a default
// the offending packets are just tossed away.  Providing a default would allow
// you to use some generic code to inspect their contents.
//
// Our lowest level packet driver interface code tells the packet driver that it
// is going to handle all EtherTypes.  You need to tell the packet driver
// interface code where the handlers for each EtherType are, or provide a default
// handler.  (If you don't provide a default handler, unmatched/handled packets
// are just tossed away.)
//
// This code uses some self modifying code to speed the process of sending a
// packet.  The software interrupt instruction is modified to reflect the
// software interrupt that is being used.  As a result, this code can only be
// used with one active packet driver at a time because the software interrupt
// can only point at one packet driver at a time.  Self modifying code is ugly
// but the library overhead for not having it was horrible.
//
// Use Packet_init to setup communications with the packet driver.

//     Packet_registerDefault to register a default handler for other etherTypes

//     Packet_getHandle to see what handle the packet driver assigned us
//     Packet_getSoftwareInt to see what software interrupt we are using
