   Description: Data type definitions and some #defines to help
     with porting from Turbo C++ to Open Watcom.

   Changes:

   2011-05-27: Initial release as open source software
   2015-01-17: Move the static_assert macro here since it is almost
               always included early.

// Typedefs for common data types.  These make it very easy to see
// if a datatype is signed or unsigned and how big it is at a glance.
// Very useful when moving between platforms where int might not be
// 32 bits.

typedef unsigned char uint8_t;     //  8 bit int, range 0 to 255
typedef unsigned int  uint16_t;    // 16 bit int, range 0 to 64K
typedef unsigned long uint32_t;    // 32 bit int, range 0 to 4GB

typedef signed char   int8_t;      //  8 bit int, range -128 to +127
typedef signed int    int16_t;     // 16 bit int, range -32K to +32K
typedef signed long   int32_t;     // 32 bit int, range -2GB to +2GB

// This union lets us express a 4 byte quantity in 2 different ways:
//
// - A single 32 bit int
// - An array of four 8 bit ints

} uint32_union_t;



// This union lets us express a 2 byte quantity in 2 different ways:

// - An array of two 8 bit ints

// Common types that are going to use constantly.

typedef uint8_t  EthAddr_t[6];  // An Ethernet address is 6 bytes
typedef uint16_t EtherType;     // 16 bits representing an Ethernet frame type
typedef uint8_t  IpAddr_t[4];   // An IPv4 address is 4 bytes
typedef uint8_t  Ipv6Addr_t[8]; // An IPv6 address is 8 bytes

// Static assert macro; used for compile-time parameter checks.  Defines an

// error.

// Misc: Useful but not worth a file on their own

// According to the DOS 5 manual, a path may be up to 66 characters including
// the drive letter, colon, and a starting backslash.  It doesn't say anything
// about a trailing backlash, so I'm going to assume it is in there.  (If I'm
// wrong this is easy enough to fix.)
//
// A max length path including a trailing backslash and an 8.3 filename then
// require 79 characters, including the terminating null character.
