// General rules for ARP
//
// - If you get a request, add the requestor to your cache.  If they are
//   looking for you they will probably talk to you soon.
// - If you see somebody else get a reply, update your cache if needed
//   but don't add a new entry.
// - Drop a cache entry if it is older than 10 minutes.  (Not implemented yet)
// - If you are out of room, drop the oldest entry.
//
// We don't bother aging the ARP cache because this is DOS, and we really
// don't expect to be running for years at a time.  Machines generally don't
// change their MAC addresses unless something bad happens to them.
//
// Even worse, mTCP will actively cache the ARP address of the next hop for
// each socket to avoid having to constantly look up the next hop in the ARP
// cache. :-)  This is not standard behavior; it assumes that your network
// topology is not changing.  There will be a new configuration option to
// disable this optimization if it freaks you out.
//
//
// Detecting IP address conflicts
//
// To detect an IP address conflict just ARP your own IP address and wait
// for a response with a MAC address that is not yours.  If something winds
// up in the cache then you know that something else is using your IP address.
//
// This code does two things to help that.  It lets you ARP your own IP address
// and it will not respond to itself.  And if it gets an response back with
// the correct MAC address it ignores it.  (A DHCP server that just gave you
// an address might respond, and that is ok.)  But if something else responds,
// it gets added to the table where presumably it will be found and reported
// as an error.
//
// Right now, only Utils::initStack tries to detect address conflicts.
// Use that code as a model if you need to detect conflicts too.
