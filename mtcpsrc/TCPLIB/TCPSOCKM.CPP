   Description: TCP socket manager code

   Changes:

   2011-05-27: Initial release as open source software

*/




// TcpSocketManager
//
// Routines to manage the active list and free list of sockets.  Routines
// include:
//
// - list setup
// - allocate and deallocate from the free list
// - 'accept' syscall to formally give a new socket created by a listening
//   socket to the user.

// Tables
//
// Do not write code that depends on the position of a socket
// in these arrays.  When a socket is removed the last socket on
// the list gets moved down to take its place so there are no
// holes in the table.
//
// If you are processing the table and you remove an entry, give
// up and start again because you changed the order of things.
//
// Todo: Add a high water mark for the number of active sockets?

//
// If a listening socket resulted in a new socket you need to 'accept'
// the new socket.

// The socket is already in established state - the user just doesn't
// have a pointer to it.  Calling this routine gives you the first
// socket in the active list that was created as the result of a listening
// socket, which is not necessarily the order it was established in.
// You may have to call this a few times to get all of the new sockets.
//
// Before the accept is done the socket is live, and will receive data.
// But eventually it will have to drop packets when it runs out of buffer
// space.  So don't wait too long between checking for new sockets.
//
// Call this periodically to see if new sockets are available and to
// clear out ones that didn't quite make it.

  // us on the way to closing before we got accepted!  Modify this
