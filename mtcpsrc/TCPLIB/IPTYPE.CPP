// IP Protocol descriptions
//
// This table is an array that has a description for each IP protocol up
// to around index 64.  After that I got tired of typing and gave up.
// If you want to add more you can, just don't skip any.  (If you want
// to be able to skip around you will need to add type numbers for each
// description and use a search algorithm, not a simple table lookup.)
