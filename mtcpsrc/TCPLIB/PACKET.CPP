   Description: Packet driver buffer management and packet driver
     interface code.

   Changes:

   2011-05-27: Initial release as open source software
   2015-01-10: Changes to decouple the upper layers from this layer;
               Change to use self modifying code to gain a little
               speed back.
   2015-04-30: Undo the self modifying code; it seems to have a very
               bad effect when running spdtest on the Pentium 133
               with the Linksys card.  (The packet driver is constantly
               reporting sending errors; it's not worth fighting for.)

// Buffer management
//
// Remember, this is code that defines buffers for incoming data.  Buffers
// for data being sent are managed by the part of the stack sending the data.
//
// We use a stack to store the free packets.  This should give us quick
// access when we need it.  It's also cache friendly on newer systems.
//
// We use ring buffer to store packets that have arrived in order.  The ring
// buffer is processed one packet at a time in order.  As each packet is
// processed the app may return it to the free pool or hold onto it.  Ether
// way, it's out of the ring buffer.  The ring buffer is one slot larger than
// the number of buffers so that we never get confused between a full buffer
// and an empty one.
//
// All of this data should be treated as "private" except for the
// lowFreeCount, which is advertised in the .H file.

// We don't ever use the incoming length, so as an optimization we
// can #define it out.

//
// We are using the normal malloc call so you can not allocate more than
// 64KB of storage for receive buffers.  Also keep in mind that the memory
// model makes a difference too; the small memory models may have much
// less than 64KB available for buffers depending on what else has used
// the heap.
//
// This code should work no matter which memory model you choose.  In the
// large data models the buffer pointers are created and normalized
// to avoid offset wrapping problems later on.
//
// Even though everything is initialized at the end of the function, we do
// not setup the free buffer count to its true value until we are told to
// do so later on.  This allows us to setup other data structures in higher
// levels of the stack before turning on the flow of packets.  (Once we set
// the number of free buffers to something other than 0, the packet driver
// will be able to start using buffers.)

      // about it.
      //
      // We could force the use of far pointers, but that has a lot of
